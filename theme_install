You can create / change your q & a website theme 
------------------------------------------------

You have two options, 
- You can override entire views and static files such as stylesheets, javascripts and images
- You can just override static files such as stylesheets, javascripts and images


1. Override just static files
-----------------------------

You need following folders:

* static/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/js
* static/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/css
* static/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/images

Create these folders, and the files within these folders with the same name.
After creating your custom files, you should change settings table, the value of the 'static_files_dir' key.


2. Override entire theme
------------------------

To create your custom theme, you need following folders:

* static/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/js
* static/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/css
* static/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/images

* application/views/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/answer
* application/views/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/comment
* application/views/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/email
* application/views/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/errors
* application/views/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/partial
* application/views/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/question
* application/views/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/reserved
* application/views/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/tag
* application/views/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/template
* application/views/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/user

You have to create these folders, and the files within these folders with the same name.
You can copy & paste some files from default_theme, if you do not want to override a part of the default theme, like javascripts.

After creating your custom files, you should change settings table, the value of the 'active_theme' key.

That's all.
